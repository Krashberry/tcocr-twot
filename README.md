<!-- A Narrative Game By Kiraah Grandberry -->

## Overview
'The Chronicles of Sister Rosewyne: The Wards of Tideport' is a narrative/choose your own adventure game following a Cleric of the Goddess oft caled The Lady Of The Water. She has been summoned to the island after a particularly bad storm to renew the wards of the local Vessel and those surrounding the borders of the remote town of Tideport. Of course, nothing is ever so simple as it would seem in a world where the ancient magics of old are creeping more and more into the mundane world.

## User Story
    - The user clicks the 'Begin' button
    - They are given some flavor text to set the mood, some background on the setting, and are introduced to the protagonist
        + Button is just leading to next screen
    - They are given the chance to make some observations as they make their way through town to the Vessel [a temple] of 'The Lady of The Water', should they choose to do so they may see some future NPCs
        + Buttons let them observe some shops 
    - They will then arrive at The Vessel where they will meet the local Eldist Sister who will inform them that something in the town's Od has seemed off but because they are not skilled with The Art they could not confirm if they were right about their misgivings or do anything about it and so they tell Candace [who I will refer to as The Player henceforth] about the Ward Points that they need to re-seal
        + Buttons will allow The Player to ask the Eldist Sister some questions, which may lead to them getting an item   
    - This will open things up for the player to choose which Ward they want to visit 
        + Buttons will give the player options for which Ward to visit
    - Each Ward will offer a small puzzle that the player will need to complete in order to re-empower it
        + Buttons would be the options for going through the process of re-empowering the Ward. This could look like a series of riddles, which you may need to get a certain amount correct for to re-empower The Ward successfully, for example.
    - Each Ward will take a day to re-empower overall.
        + Buttons will allow The Player the option to choose from some tasks that they will have time to do one of the offered tasks before sleeping
    - Once The Player has completed the re-empowerment of the outer wards they will need to re-empower the one at the Vessel. This will release a powerful Shard [a chaotic creature].
        + Buttons will allow The Player some options for trying to re-seal the Shard or attack it. Based on a combination of the tasks completed and items collected The Player will finish the re-empowering of The Wards of Tideport and either re-seal the Shard or they will accidentally release the Shard into the world. 
    - The game will then allow The Player some options about how they want to wrap things in Tideport up before they recieve a missive with their next assignment. 
        + Buttons will allow The Player the option of sending their own letters, possibly recruiting an understudy [unsure of the difficulty of this], etc.
