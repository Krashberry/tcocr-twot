# Game Details
<!-- Title of The Game -->
 The Chronicles of Sister Rosewyne: The Wards of Tideport
<!-- Narrative and major code base by Kiraah Grandberry-->
<!-- Version 2 of the game's code base signifigantlly contributed to by Alex Shaver -->

## Outlook
I attempted to make a choose your own adventure game with riddles and leveling. Ultimatlery I was unssuccessful at this and ended up starting over and making a puzzle game. The reason I wanted to make it in it's first iteration was that I have always been a fan of RPGs and have always found text adventure games charming. The second, paired down version, is still very flavorful and has the core word puzzle mechanic as the previous iteration, so it is still charming in it's own way, but not as heartfelt as I feel it would have been if it was my originally intended projects. 

## Plot Overview
<!-- 'The Chronicles of Sister Rosewyne: The Wards of Tideport' is a narrative/choose your own adventure game following a Cleric of the Goddess oft called The Lady Of The Water. She has been summoned to the island after a particularly bad storm to renew the Wards of the local Vessel and those surrounding the borders of the remote town of Tideport. Of course, nothing is ever so simple as it would seem in a world where the ancient magics of old are creeping more and more into the mundane world.  -->

## Technology Overview
The technology used in my game is vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS. With a tiny bit of flexbox in the styling. The first iteration used some object oriented programming but my second iteration ended up having to abandon this. 

## Unresolved Issues
In the version being submitted I was unable to implement inventory, or specifically dagger posession, tracking and proper "level" progression. The lack of proper CSS styling is also something that I will definitley be coming back to. In the original version I was struggling with not the recognition of the possession of the dagger but having the code recognize it in a specific scene and changing the text based of this of course was impossible without this functionality. I had a lot of trouble with having various tutors all trying to help me but essentially ended up with very hodge podge code because of the varied advice I was getting since everyone had their own way of trying to help me/their own way they'd approach the challenges I was trying to meet.
